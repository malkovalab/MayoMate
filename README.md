# MayoMate
MayoMate is a Python package designed to facilitate the discovery and visualization of recombination events, mutations, and mutation clusters in Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiotic outcomes. This package offers a comprehensive toolkit for:

- Identifying and visualizing recombination events based on a panel of parental SNPs
- Identifying, visualizing, and classifying mutation clusters.
- Association of mutation clusters with identified recombination events.
- Inferring the length of hypermutable single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).
- Identifying promoter mutation rates.
- Conducting statistical comparisons between various mutants.
MayoMate provides a toolkit for researchers and bioinformaticians working with yeast meiotic WGS data, aiding in the analysis and interpretation of meiotic mutagenesis data.
